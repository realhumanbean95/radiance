# Radiance

## About
This is a place for me to practice putting pixels on screen, and to learn and try out rendering techniques.
It may change in the future, but for now it's just a small OpenGL rendering engine. :)

## Demo
![shown: KBaM fly camera, objects with different vertex semantics in the same scene](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/realhumanbean95/radiance/main/resources/demo-footage/fly-camera.gif)

## Building
TODO
*Lighting
*Shadows
*Model loading
*Performance optimzations (such as occlusion culling)
